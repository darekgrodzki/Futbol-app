This is rather training of using Rect-Router, fetch and dataObj then useful aplication, but it works :). I've hosted it on my server because there is a problem with rendering it. GitHub uses https protocol and API standard http and it causes problem.

CSS - background colors are of my favourite football club - Legia Warszawa.
